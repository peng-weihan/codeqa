{"question": "What is the purpose of the template_name parameter in the RenderTemplateView.__init__ method?", "answer": null, "relative_code_list": null, "ground_truth": "The template_name parameter in RenderTemplateView.__init__ specifies which template should be rendered when the dispatch_request method is called. This value is stored as an instance variable for later use.", "score": null}
{"question": "What is the relationship between the RenderTemplateView class and Flask's View class?", "answer": null, "relative_code_list": null, "ground_truth": "RenderTemplateView inherits from Flask's View class, as indicated by the class definition. This provides the basic structure for a view class in Flask, with RenderTemplateView implementing the required dispatch_request method.", "score": null}
{"question": "Why does the dispatch_request method return a string instead of a Response object?", "answer": null, "relative_code_list": null, "ground_truth": "The dispatch_request method returns a string because Flask's render_template function returns a string containing the rendered template. Flask's framework will automatically convert this string into a proper Response object when handling the request.", "score": null}
{"question": "What sequence of operations does RenderTemplateView follow when handling a request?", "answer": null, "relative_code_list": null, "ground_truth": "When handling a request, RenderTemplateView first initializes with a template_name, then when dispatch_request is called, it renders the specified template using Flask's render_template function and returns the result.", "score": null}
{"question": "How would you extend RenderTemplateView to add context variables to the template rendering?", "answer": null, "relative_code_list": null, "ground_truth": "To add context variables, you would modify the dispatch_request method to accept additional parameters and pass them to render_template as keyword arguments, or add a method to set context variables on the instance before rendering.", "score": null}
{"question": "What is the type signature of the dispatch_request method in RenderTemplateView?", "answer": null, "relative_code_list": null, "ground_truth": "The dispatch_request method has the type signature (self: RenderTemplateView) -> str, indicating it takes only the instance parameter and returns a string.", "score": null}
{"question": "Why was the View class selected as the base class for RenderTemplateView?", "answer": null, "relative_code_list": null, "ground_truth": "The View class was selected as the base class because it provides the fundamental interface for class-based views in Flask, requiring only the implementation of dispatch_request to handle HTTP requests.", "score": null}
{"question": "How does RenderTemplateView ensure type safety in its method signatures?", "answer": null, "relative_code_list": null, "ground_truth": "RenderTemplateView uses Python type hints in its method signatures (str for template_name parameter and return type annotation -> str for dispatch_request) to indicate expected types, though these are not enforced at runtime without additional type checking tools.", "score": null}
