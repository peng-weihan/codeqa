{"question": "Why does attempting to reverse an irreversible migration trigger an IrreversibleError instead of a standard DatabaseError?", "answer": null, "relative_code_list": null, "ground_truth": "The IrreversibleError is specifically designed to indicate that a migration marked as irreversible is being attempted to be reversed, which is a logical error in the migration process rather than a database operation error. By inheriting from RuntimeError instead of DatabaseError, it clearly separates this logical constraint violation from typical database-related issues, making error handling more precise and allowing developers to distinguish between database operation failures and migration logic violations.", "score": null}
{"question": "Why does the MutuallyReferentialTests class rely on implicit success checks rather than explicit assertions for verifying the correctness of mutually referential relationships?", "answer": null, "relative_code_list": null, "ground_truth": "The MutuallyReferentialTests class relies on implicit success checks because the test's correctness is determined by the absence of exceptions during the execution of operations like save() and delete(), which inherently verify the integrity of the mutually referential relationships between Parent and Child models.

{"question": "How does the Collector class handle dependency resolution when cascading deletes through parent-child relationships while maintaining transaction integrity?", "answer": null, "relative_code_list": null, "ground_truth": "The Collector class handles dependency resolution during cascading deletes by first sorting models based on their dependencies using the sort() method, which ensures parent models are deleted before child models. It maintains transaction integrity by performing all deletions within a single atomic transaction block, using the delete() method which coordinates pre_delete/post_delete signals, fast deletes, and field updates while tracking deleted objects through a Counter. The dependencies are tracked in the dependencies attribute and resolved through topological sorting to prevent constraint violations.", "score": null}
