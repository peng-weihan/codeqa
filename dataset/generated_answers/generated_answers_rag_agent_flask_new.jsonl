This is documented in the Flask documentation: [2](#6-1) \n\n## Why Direct Class Decoration Doesn't Work\n\nThe documentation explicitly warns against applying decorators directly to the View class: [3](#6-2) \n\nThis is because the View class itself is not the view function - it's a factory that creates view functions. When you decorate the class directly, you're decorating the wrong target. The actual view function is generated later by `as_view()`.\n\n## Practical Example\n\nHere's how the `decorators` attribute works in practice: [4](#6-3) \n\nThe equivalent manual approach would be: [5](#6-4) \n\n## Order of Application\n\nThe decorators in the `decorators` list are applied in the order they appear, which corresponds to bottom-to-top decorator syntax: [6](#6-5) \n\n## Historical Context\n\nThis functionality was added in Flask 0.8 to provide a clean way to apply decorators to class-based views: [7](#6-6) \n\n**Notes**\n\nThe `decorators` attribute ensures that decorators are applied to the actual callable view function that Flask uses for routing, rather than to the class factory. This is essential because Flask's routing system works with functions, not classes directly.\n\nWiki pages you might want to explore:\n- [Core Components (pallets/flask)](/wiki/pallets/flask#2)\n- [Views and Responses (pallets/flask)](/wiki/pallets/flask#3.2)"}

In the `dispatch_request` method of `MethodView`, after determining which HTTP method handler to call, Flask wraps the method call with `current_app.ensure_sync()`: [1](#7-0) \n\nThis is the critical line that ensures async methods work properly. The `ensure_sync` method is Flask's universal mechanism for handling both synchronous and asynchronous functions uniformly.\n\n## How `ensure_sync` Works\n\nThe `ensure_sync` method in Flask's application class detects whether a function is a coroutine and handles it appropriately: [2](#7-1) \n\nIf the method is async (detected via `iscoroutinefunction`), Flask converts it to a synchronous callable using `async_to_sync`: [3](#7-2) \n\nThis conversion uses the `asgiref` library to run the async function in an event loop and return the result synchronously, which is required since Flask operates in a WSGI (synchronous) context.\n\n## Practical Example\n\nThe test suite demonstrates this working with async `MethodView` methods: [4](#7-3) \n\nWhen you call these async methods (like `get()` or `post()`), the `dispatch_request` method automatically handles the async nature through `ensure_sync`, allowing the methods to use `await` syntax while still working within Flask's synchronous request handling framework.\n\n## Integration with View Base Class\n\nThis same pattern is used in the base `View` class for the `dispatch_request` method: [5](#7-4) \n\nThis ensures consistency across all Flask class-based views, whether they're basic `View` subclasses or `MethodView` subclasses.\n\nThe `ensure_sync` approach allows Flask to support async methods in `MethodView` without requiring any special handling from the developer - you can simply define your HTTP method handlers as `async def` and use `await` within them, and Flask handles the synchronization automatically.\n\n**Notes**\n\nThis async support was added in Flask 2.0 and requires installing Flask with the async extra (`pip install flask[async]`). The same `ensure_sync` mechanism is used throughout Flask for handling async route handlers, error handlers, and other callback functions.\n\nWiki pages you might want to explore:\n- [Context System (pallets/flask)](/wiki/pallets/flask#2.2)\n- [Async Support (pallets/flask)](/wiki/pallets/flask#6.2)"}

It checks if a function is a coroutine function and wraps it appropriately to run in an event loop if needed.\n\nWhen ensure_sync encounters an async function, it delegates to async_to_sync app.py:980-1001, which uses the asgiref library to run the coroutine in an event loop within a thread. For synchronous functions, it simply returns them unchanged.\n\nThis pattern is used consistently throughout Flask's request handling:\n\n- View functions: In dispatch_request for executing the matched route handler\n- Error handlers: In handle_http_exception app.py:777 and handle_user_exception app.py:809\n- Request hooks: In preprocess_request app.py:1291 and process_response app.py:1314-1319\n- Teardown functions: In do_teardown_request app.py:1356\n\nThe same mechanism is used in Flask's class-based views. Both View.as_view views.py:110 and MethodView.dispatch_request views.py:191 use current_app.ensure_sync to handle potentially async methods.\n\nThis design allows you to write view functions using either def or async def syntax without changing how you register routes. Flask automatically detects and handles the difference, enabling async operations like concurrent database queries or API calls within a single request while maintaining compatibility with existing synchronous code.\n\nThe ensure_sync call in dispatch_request is therefore fundamental to Flask's async support - it's the mechanism that makes Flask's \"async-aware but WSGI-compatible\" architecture possible."}
