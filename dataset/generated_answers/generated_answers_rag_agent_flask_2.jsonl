Here's how it works and the potential security implications:\n\n1. **Handling Multiple Secret Keys**:\n   - The `get_signing_serializer` method checks if `SECRET_KEY_FALLBACKS` is configured in the application's config. If so, it appends these fallback keys to a list of keys, with the primary `secret_key` at the top.\n   - The `URLSafeTimedSerializer` from `itsdangerous` is then initialized with this list of keys. This allows the serializer to try each key in sequence when verifying a session cookie, ensuring backward compatibility if the primary key is rotated.\n\n2. **Security Implications**:\n   - **Key Rotation**: The use of fallback keys facilitates seamless key rotation without invalidating existing sessions. However, it also means that an attacker who compromises an old key can still forge session cookies until all fallback keys are retired.\n   - **Key Management**: The security of the session depends on the secrecy of all keys in the list. If any key in `SECRET_KEY_FALLBACKS` is compromised, it weakens the overall security of the session mechanism.\n   - **Performance**: The verification process may take slightly longer as the system attempts multiple keys, but this overhead is negligible in most cases.\n\n3. **Code Reference**:\n   - The `get_signing_serializer` method (lines 317-335 in `src/flask/sessions.py`) demonstrates the handling of `SECRET_KEY_FALLBACKS`.\n   - The `URLSafeTimedSerializer` is configured to use these keys for signing and verification, ensuring backward compatibility while maintaining security.\n\nIn summary, while the use of `SECRET_KEY_FALLBACKS` provides flexibility for key rotation, it introduces a trade-off between convenience and security. Proper key management practices, such as retiring old keys promptly, are essential to mitigate potential risks."}
